#Flappy Bird Clone

##Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python and the Pygame library. The goal was to rebuild the core mechanics of the original game from scratch to gain experience with game development concepts such as user input handling, collision detection, animation, and score tracking.

This project allowed me to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming, event-driven logic, and the Pygame development environment while building something fun and interactive.

##Features

- Responsive player controls using keyboard input
- Randomly generated pipe obstacles
- Collision detection with ground and pipes
- Real-time score tracking
- Game over and restart functionality
- Basic animation and background graphics

##Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- Visual Studio Code
